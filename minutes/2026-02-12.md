### Agenda + Notes

1. Introductions & [Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/)

2. **Questions/comments** from the last meeting.

   - None

3. **Topics of discussion (**[****Kanban****](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/198) **/** [****WSG****](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg) **/** [****IG****](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-ig/issues)**)**

   - [TAG feedback](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1181#issuecomment-3856405135) - please review

     - TAG = [Technical Architecture Group](https://tag.w3.org/) 

     - The TAG has reviewed ¼ of the WSG so far and given significant feedback. It may push back the timeline.

     - Tim: Anyone reviewed the feedback? A: no.

     - Alex: some of the feedback is straightforward, bug fixes, tweaks, wording.

       - Other items require discussion: the Introduction (which needs an editorial review anyway - wasn’t done before) has some missing elements.

       - Also requested editorial updates generally

       - Glossary needs improvement. More adequate definitions & explanations. Rose and Sid also involved

       - Some guidelines are being queried for various reasons, such as overlap (e.g. with WCAG).
       - TAG will come back with more feedback after we resubmit based on their feedback.

       - Phillipe of W3C Technical Strategy said: this might not be done by the end of the charter period

     - Rose: regarding the Introduction, it has had no verification yet (typos and all). The TAG saw a version that hadn’t had QA yet.

       - Rose tends to work on the Intro last (b/c it is a summary)

       - Suggests we restart the Intro a fresh document. Reuse what makes sense; other parts are dated.

       - Hopes that other WSG IEs can contribute to sections such as glossary.

     - Sarah Zama: How are we meant to respond to the feedback?

       - E.g. TAG says we should remove some sections. If we disagree, what do we do?

       - Tim: we are within our rights to push back on feedback we disagree with. We have 63 members, but few of us are W3C members. But most are advanced on web sustainability whereas TAG are not. Pushback would only happen if this WSG is in alignment.

     - Rose: how much can we deviate from TAGs guidance - not a lot.

       - Other specs also needed a lot of explanation. But if you look at WCAG, it is not as philosophical as our introduction.

         - See: <https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/>

         - And <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#intro>

     - Siddesh: A lot of prior discussion on definitions, etc.
       - <https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/191>

       - Alex: some of TAG mentions of guidelines have previously been flagged (overlap with WCAG, privacy, other standards). So we would need a good reason to keep them in.

       - These overlaps are prime for removal unless there is a clear sustainability reason to keep.

       - On collaborating with TAG: they are open to conversation, it’s not dictatorial. Their reasoning makes sense, so we’d need well-reasoned rebuttals.

       - Generally, they are giving good advice.

     - Tim: how can we get more W3C folks to engage.

     - Susannah Hill: If we have overlap, we should still mention it. As part of our education mission. E.G. “why accessibility is also a sustainability issue”. And cross-link to the other spec.

     - Alex: from Tzviya -”TAG are the experts, we must work with them; they are not entrenched in sustainability so when there is a lack of clarity, we must provide it”

       - This should flow from a solid clear definition of what it is we’re doing.

     - Susannah Hill: the overlaps are also a positive - “do these changes, you get these other benefits”.

     - Rose: we should look at how other specs deal with overlap. E.g. Security and Performance.

       - Looking at WCAG: their Understanding document is separated in its own site.

         - <https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/>

       - Our intro is broad, our audience often wants to get to the actionable content.

       - The way WCAG is structured is nice - it encouraged deeper dives \[but doesn’t get in your way].


     - Alex: We have similar to understanding with STAR (further information, techniques, tests), the benefits supplement, and the resources doc

     - Tim: we should embrace the overlap - and that’s 2-way, they should also address overlap in their area. The other groups have been historically helpful.

     - Susannah: the more we can outsource to other specs, the more readable our document.

       - Alex: is that in support of removing?

       - Susannah: removing; we keep the heading and principle, but see XYZ specification for deeper details. And they link back

       - Alex: the other specs do not update very often (ironic understatement)

     -

   - [Clarify definition of Web Sustainability](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/219) - can we use this as a benchmark for all Guidelines?

     -

   - Introduction - strong statement about sustainability, use as benchmark for the rest of doc

     - Tim: the intro should link back to everything we do in the spec (per Tzviya's comment).

     - Rose in Chat: For example - look how tiny this intro is… <https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/>

       - This is a VERY specific tech. They only actually talk about "harm" caused by content injection.

       - <https://www.w3.org/TR/UISecurity/#intro> - this one has an example of a longer intro and conformance notes (also a work in progress).

       - It is short, and it stays in its lane.
       - Remember we are talking to techies

     - Alex: we have a broad audience though; our previous intro was 3 times the length.

       - TAG feedback - confusion about non-carbon related items eg “environment”.

       - We can emphasize the E S and G.

       - Balancing act: not too long, but can’t have a short intro with everything in it.

     - Susannah: we have unique challenges because of our topic; consider [breaking parts out for digestibility]

     - Rose: more examples from WCAG on content structure. .

       - E.g. Centered text is problematic, I needed help to understand why. This is a good example of understanding docs and the structure. A lot is reusable. <https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text>. This is a nuanced piece of guidance that has its own stand-alone explanation outside the SC.

       - We shouldn’t say “read these 10 resources to find out how to meet this SC” or to understand the “why”.

       - WCAG’s approach to content structuring here is worth emulating.

     - Alex: We aren't looking at creating an understanding doc at this stage as the main spec is what needs to get to NOTE and STMT. Supplements will come later.

     - Anne Faubry: we are not just about environment, or web (by group consensus), or results. We are also about the means, the processes etc.

       - Thinking about how big companies ingest this type of content.

       - We should improve our own writing skills (learning from Rose’s WCAG examples above).

       - Do other specs contain content about outcomes and results? (Tim: there are 500 W3C specs so maybe but none to mind).

     - Siddhesh: re impact; does the W3C track implementation metrics. How do we evaluate how successful our guidelines are?

     - Alex: for impact, the practical specifications such as CSS. They have implementation reports. They use the [httparchive.or](http://httparchive.or)g data to show which elements/selectors are being adopted.

       - The browser vendors also track what parts of the spec are being requested.

       - We don’t get that level of analysis for WSG because it is hard to machine-test, it’s not binary.

     - Mike: W3C is a standards body, not an implementation or impact tracking body. The monitoring bodies (of the EU) are responsible for the tracking.

       - We should concentrate on building a standard that people can use.

     - Rose:  Security group talks vaguely about “harm” - they don’t get into details or justify guidelines.

       - Seems WSG is held to a higher level of evidence

       - Alex: “a group of experts agree that harm may occur” - is sufficient. Extending that thinking to WSG work - “our experts think it is likely that…” - without having to provide much evidence.

       - Rose: our spec works harder at joining the dots for people.

   - Revised roadmap/timeline - up in the air

     - Tim: Our intended Earth Day pub date looks overly aspirational; we need to look ahead to the next version of the charter.

   - Conformance update (Hidde)

     - Alex: we’ve been redrafting the conformance part of the introduction. This will eventually feed back to the wider group, but it isn’t ready for review.

   - **Reminder:** Next week is [APAC meeting](https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/eeb213f8-e9f8-49b2-b60f-300d514a520b/)

4. **Community + News**

   - TBD

5. **Other discussion/questions**

   - Tim: reminder - the next meeting will be at the later time.
